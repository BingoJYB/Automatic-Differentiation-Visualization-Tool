# Automatic-Differentiation-Visualization-Tool

Derivatives play an important role in many real life applications. Automatic differentiation (AD) can be used to compute those derivatives. The adjoint model is one type of AD. We design and implement a debugger helping find bugs in the overloaded code. The debugger is designed as one code viewer to show the debugged code on the left and one graph viewer to show the computational graph on the right. There is a mapping between assignments in the code and nodes in the linearized directed acyclic graph (DAG). If either of the assignment or the node is selected, its mapped part is also highlighted. The debugger also offers other functionalities such as highlighting the code syntax, zooming in and zooming out the graph, dragging the graph and exporting the graph as a PDF file. We implement the user interface by Qt. dco/c++ is used as an AD engine to produce a dot file containing the information about the DAG. Two parameters, layer number and time to live, are set to filter the original DAG to a small, human-readable DAG parsed by Graphviz for layout. The mapping is realized by an instrumentation tool using Clang tooling infrastructure. The debugger is compiled into a shared object and called from dco/c++ during interpretation.
